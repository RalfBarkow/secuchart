CPU idle;no=Proof of work, partial=sluggish due to Idling too little in foreground or measurable amount of processing in background; yes=otherwise
Power saving;Ensure that device wakes up as few times as possible, filters and batches events on remote side, no open sockets, delegated peer tracking
Bandwidth frugal;Conservation by lazy loading, previews, adaptive detail, incremental sync, fewer round trips, tokenization, batching transfers to improve compression, tweaked key schedule, multicasting hubs
Multiple devices;If the same account can be used at the same time from multiple devices, syncing contacts, messages and notifications.
Multiple accounts;If you can stay logged in with multiple accounts on the same device and application without external isolation techniques
Application locking;Unlock the account or certain chats with a PIN code, passphrase, fingerprints or facial likeness
;Security
End-to-end encryption;
E2EE keys shielded from operator;Regardless of this, certain OS vendors might also have access to your keys
Deniability;Deny sending a message, repudiability
Replay prevention;Of third party buffering nodes
Downgrade resistance;Mitigation against downgrade attacks

Metadata protection;
Perfect forward secrecy;
Remote message removal;Also called redaction or deletion
Remote message correction;Also called editing
Message expiration;Also called retention time or disappearing messages

Register without app;
;Sustainability
First release;
Transparent financing;
Active development;yes=developer availability is not a bottleneck for progress, partial=occasional hobby development or basic maintenance work, no=no development or only ensuring it builds
Multi-party development;no=one-man show, yes=highest level contributors are exchangeable, equal drivers, partial=regular contributions from multiple people
No-cost tier;
Payment choices;
Vendor legal entity kind;Individual, entrepreneur, non-profit, single-person for-profit, multi-party for-profit
Transparency reports;
Vendor jurisdiction;
Infrastructure jurisdiction;
Infrastructure provider;
Isolated self-hosting;It can be deployed on-premise in a LAN without internet
User can extend network with node;Improving the scaling of the system and communicate with anyone (i.e., if P2P or federated)
Identity not controlled by vendor;Will the system still work if the developer goes bankrupt
Account deactivation after device compromise;Solvable with centralized or federated servers or with revocation certificates in P2P.
Account recovery after device compromise;Solvable with centralized or federated servers or with subkeys, revocation and secret sharing in P2P.
Spam protection;If it gained worldwide adoption
;Topology
Offline;no=Not useful if disconnected. partial=Only read a few buffered messages or compose new ones. yes=Reboot, add new contacts, past logs, search, cache list of groups or users, settings.
Servers required;
Servers optional;
Serverless WAN mode;If communicating over the internet might scale without (a vast amount of) dedicated servers, i.e. by supernode promotion and DHT
Serverless LAN mode;If you can communicate without an internet connection and a server
Network store and forward;You can compose messages to your peer even if the two of you aren't online at the same time
Wireless mode;Built-in support for peering with nearby nodes over ISM wireless either to sync or as part of a mesh
IP shielded from peers;
Tor access of vendor operated network;Yes=Without involving Tor exit nodes, no=Tor exit nodes blocked, limited=otherwise
IPv6 access of vendor operated network;Still green if only registration is limited to IPv4
Vendor operated network inaccessible from countries;If it is illegal or blocked here or if the vendor prohibits usage or its infrastructure blocks users from here. Encryption itself is outlawed in many countries, do not list these.
Third party clients;yes=Multiple full featured clients available;no=Terms of service prohibits access to vendor operated network
