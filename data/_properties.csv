CPU idle;no=Proof of work, partial=sluggish due to Idling too little in foreground or measurable amount of processing in background; yes=otherwise
Power saving;Ensure that device wakes up as few times as possible, filters and batches events on remote side, no open sockets, delegated peer tracking
Bandwidth frugal;Conservation by lazy loading, previews, adaptive detail, incremental sync, fewer round trips, tokenization, batching transfers to improve compression, tweaked key schedule, multicasting hubs
Multiple devices;If the same account can be used at the same time from multiple devices, syncing contacts, messages and notifications.
Multiple accounts;If you can stay logged in with multiple accounts on the same device and application without external isolation techniques
;Security

Isolated self-hosting;It can be deployed on-premise in a LAN without internet
User can extend network with node;Improving the scaling of the system and communicate with anyone (i.e., if P2P or federated)
Identity not controlled by company;Will the system still work if the developer goes bankrupt
Account deactivation after device compromise;Solvable with centralized or federated servers or with revocation certificates in P2P.
Account recovery after device compromise;Solvable with centralized or federated servers or with subkeys, revocation and secret sharing in P2P.
Spam protection;If it gained worldwide adoption
;Topology
Offline;no=Not useful if disconnected. partial=Only read a few buffered messages or compose new ones. yes=Reboot, add new contacts, past logs, search, cache list of groups or users, settings.
Servers required;
Servers optional;
Serverless WAN mode;If communicating over the internet might scale without (a vast amount of) dedicated servers, i.e. by supernode promotion and DHT
Serverless LAN mode;If you can communicate without an internet connection and a server
Network store and forward;You can compose messages to your peer even if the two of you aren't online at the same time
Wireless mode;Built-in support for peering with nearby nodes over ISM wireless either to sync or as part of a mesh
IP shielded from peers;
Tor access of company operated network;Yes=Without involving Tor exit nodes, no=Tor exit nodes blocked, limited=otherwise
IPv6 access of company operated network;Still green if only registration is limited to IPv4
Company operated network inaccessible from countries;If it is illegal or blocked here or if the company prohibits usage or its infrastructure blocks users from here. Encryption itself is outlawed in many countries, do not list these.
