## Assumptions

* Assume that the underlying networking is already taken care of
* Can be via ethernet switches
* Possibly through wireless access points
* WAN uplink is either non-existent or intermittent.

## User story

Hosting servers within a LAN or building small meshes could still make sense, for example in the context of a large housing complex or even a dense village district. If everyone within a 500m range has the same power source, you could mind as well assume that they could either all have LAN or neither of you would. And at least you could play LAN games with your neighbors, along with syncing your mobile DTN mirrors especially if you study at work at different places.
