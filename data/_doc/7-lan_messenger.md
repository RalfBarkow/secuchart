Hosting servers within a LAN or building small meshes could still sense, for example in the context of a large housing complex or dense village district even. If everyone within a 500m range has the same power source, you could mind as well assume that they could either all have LAN or wouldn't. And at least you could play LAN games with your neighbors (along with syncing your mobile DTN mirrors especially if you study at work at different places)
