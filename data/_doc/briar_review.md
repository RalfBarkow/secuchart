> I am not online all the time, I only connect some times, receive all the messages maybe reply some and go offline again, to save battery and mobile data (btw, briar is heavy for battery and mobile data so I was not even able to have it running all the time, it was draining my data plan) other contacts that are in my same situation will not be online all the time so the chance we are both online at the same time is low, but anyway none of my contacts use Briar, they delete it immediately pretty scared and annoyed "hey!!! that crap drained my data plan!!!)
