# Threat modeling

* Useful for the tinfoil persona.
* Semi-useful for the layperson persona.

# Definition

* The nuanced technical analysis of solutions to problems both actual and theoretical.
* Actionable, based on perceived threats and their present vs future responses.

# Threat model aims

* Project design
* What can go wrong?
* Identify the problem(s)
* Find the solution(s)
* Is our current architecture good enough (remember: perfect is not the goal)
* Can be focused on 3 areas: privacy, anonymity, security, or even all 3
* Common goals are: finding answers to technical problems that may result in compromise
* Perfection is never an answer because it is not feasible
