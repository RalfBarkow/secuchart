## Costs

* It requires purchasing a special-purpose hardware device to participate.
* It is not plausible that all citizens, even ones within less developed regions would opt to purchase (or solder) this
* It is usually manufactured without economies of scale, hence is usually overpriced
* It is usually less power efficient, larger and heavier than mainstream solutions

## Seasonality

* It would just sit in the attic for many years at a time between wars
* Without regular use, we wouldn't be sure whether a device still works
* Can't know how it reacts to loading until _everybody_ rushes to use them (even the well funded cell phone industry fails in many such cases)
* During the years of idling, protocols and modulation improve so much that such a box probably needs to be replaced every 10 years irrespective of its health.
* Thus, promoting such a project is promoting accumulation of hazardous waste (in countries that already have problems with basic recycling), hazardous materials are required for manufacturing and exploiting the people where rare input minerals are mined.

## HAM

As a better alternative, licensed hardware amateurs with the required radio operator skills within each local community could bridge longer distances:

They could keep in touch with the local community using messengers supporting unlicensed wireless ad-hoc mesh, delay tolerant networking or 1-on-1 syncing using standard hardware:
