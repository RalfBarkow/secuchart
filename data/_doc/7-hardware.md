## Use cases

Such projects advertise many use cases that would otherwise be better served with another technology.

### Coordination between emergency responders

* dPMR
* Private frequencies without interference reserved for the exclusive use of the emergency responders

### Informing the public during disasters

* TV, AM/FM linear audio broadcasting
* loudspeakers

### A disaster struck area requests assistance

* Commercial satellite phone or internet subscription
* Or see HAM section

### Between civilians during disasters

For high density and short range use (a few hundred meters), see:

* #pan_mesh_dtn
* #lan_messenger

### Disaster victims requesting assistance

Caveats:

* Major catastrophes can be detected from far away via weather satellites, fire detection satellites, seismic sensors or microphones, hence it is unlikely that a beacon would carry any advantage
* The unconscious would not signal
* Those who are stuck under debris can usually not reach their specialized and thus rarely used hardware disaster radio
* If someone is not stuck under debris, they can usually leave their home or climb the roof to shout for help and/or to allow for better line of sight links
* If someone is stuck and can't leave their home, they can usually shout or transmit to their neighbors who could forward their call for help
* If the disaster is not a major catastrophe, phones and the internet could still work at a neighbor or nearby: typical urban deployments are overlapping and emergency calls can roam across all providers, hence even if all nearby sites went down, you could probably get a signal again if you bike 1km away
* It would be noble to provide a means to connect everyone in everyday situations as well to lessen the digital divide, not only in case of an emergency, but such use cases call for a different network topology

Existing alternatives:

* Ideally hop to hop via short range solutions

## Costs

* It requires purchasing a special-purpose hardware device to participate.
* It is not plausible that all citizens, even ones within less developed regions would opt to purchase (or solder) this
* It is usually manufactured without economies of scale, hence is usually overpriced
* It is usually less power efficient, larger and heavier than mainstream solutions

## Seasonality

* It would just sit in the attic for many years at a time between wars
* Without regular use, we wouldn't be sure whether a device still works
* Can't know how it reacts to loading until _everybody_ rushes to use them (even the well funded cell phone industry fails in many such cases)
* During the years of idling, protocols and modulation improve so much that such a box probably needs to be replaced every 10 years irrespective of its health.
* Thus, promoting such a project is promoting accumulation of hazardous waste (in countries that already have problems with basic recycling), hazardous materials are required for manufacturing and exploiting the people where rare input minerals are mined.

## HAM

As a better alternative, licensed hardware amateurs with the required radio operator skills within each local community could bridge longer distances:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio_operator

They could keep in touch with the local community using messengers supporting unlicensed wireless ad-hoc mesh, delay tolerant networking or 1-on-1 syncing using standard hardware.

Their position and contacts could be shared on an offline map.
