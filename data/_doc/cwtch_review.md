> I have restarted the app, now I see you
> Cwrch is not stable and hard to work with. For p2p, briar and anonymous messenger are more stable for me.
> Your last messages on Cwtch didn't arrive for me, it is really unstable

> I can only confirm what was said on 2022-03-03. Tested two phones + desktop. Pairing them together was quite a nightmare. After pairing, some messages never arrived. Or got notifications, but no messages delivered. Group was possible to create from desktop only (not sure why), but I could invite mobile clients, which was another pita experience. Only one of the mobiles eventually joined group and a day later was able to finally exchange some group messages.
