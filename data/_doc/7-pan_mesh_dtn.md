## Direct connection

You only have a direct connection between two clients if they are:

* connected through a wire
* within radio range on an unlicensed band
* within line of sight for optical communication
* within hearing range for sound propagation

## Topology

* one-on-one only
* broadcast range based individual radius of circle
* mesh routing
* flooding with hop limit
* full replication using total flooding within trusted peers, subject to timeout and cancellation

## Physical layer

* soundmodem over a free CB27 radio
* sonic communication

## Meshes

LoRa is not very spectral efficient given high density

## DTN

A mesh necessitates having a certain amount of nodes online to maintain a spanning tree. This will be problematic when power & communications links go down in certain towns.

On the other hand, if you focused more on gossip & opportunistic replication and building F2F based on real world web of trust, information could spread much better. This is something that every network gets wrong that is developed in the first world as a "hobby" (or via grant, VC, crowdfunding, etc).

### Avian carriers

This started as a joke, but pigeons can actually be thought to complete two round trips per day autonomously by placing their food up to 160 km away from their nest.

If coupled with either low tech monitoring of their arrival or wireless sync and charging and a constant and planned stream of backup birds and hardware, it could provide a commercially viable decentralized alternative to erecting and maintaining expensive relay sites over long distances.
