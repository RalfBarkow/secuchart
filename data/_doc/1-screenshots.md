# Screenshots

## Why

* A representative teaser image for comparison or two (TODO: define what this should depict to be comparable)
* If you can't find a reference to a given property in textual form, but if it can be clearly seen on the image
* In gallery mode, a caption could be generated based on which properties it is linked from

## Where to link

* Original website of each software
* Original repository of each software
* Other websites where hotlinking is not frowned upon

## Upload upstream

The picture should ideally be lossless PNG or WEBP. Keep it small by not showing much true color content if possible.

You should ideally submit a pull request in the repository of the respective software if you need to add a screenshot. It could reach their website and their app stores as well.

## SecuChart-assets

* We must have permission to distribute the produced imagery
* Only upload imagery of FOSS, because fair use is messy
* The license should be linked from a `README.md` placed in each subdirectory
* Sometimes visual assets have a different license than the software itself!
* You must account for every pixel on the screen: user avatars, emoji and stickers can all be copyrighted individually
* Real names and stable pseudonyms raise privacy issues
* When in doubt, block out parts with a red rectangle (#f00)
