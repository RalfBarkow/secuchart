# Screenshots

## Where to link

* Original website of each software
* Original repository of each software
* Other websites where hotlinking is not frowned upon

## Upload upstream

You should ideally submit a pull request in the repository of the respective software if you need to add a screenshot. It could reach their website and their app stores as well.

## SecuChart-assets

* We must have permission to distribute the produced imagery.
* Only upload imagery of FOSS, because fair use is messy
* The license should be linked from a `README.md` placed in each subdirectory
* Sometimes visual assets have a different license than the software itself
* You must account for every pixel on the screen: user avatars, emoji and stickers can all be copyrighted individually
* When in doubt, block out parts with a red rectangle (#f00)
