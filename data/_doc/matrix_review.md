> they’ll be turning on end-to-end encryption by default for all private conversations.
> building out their flagship Matrix hosting platform (Modular.im) and building it into Riot — “so that groups of users can easily hop onto their own self-sovereign servers”.
> they intend to work on combating abuse [...] the question of how you moderate hateful communications could easily get overlooked.
