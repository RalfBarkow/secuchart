# Legality of third party clients

TL;DR Their servers = their rules

## Legality

If you (=the user) use the telecommunication service (=the service) provided by a given legal entity or natural person (=the provider), a legal contract is made between the user and the provider.

Courts accept various forms of consent when agreeing to a contract:

* A written signature on a piece of paper.
* A government issued electronic signature.
* Oral agreement in person.
* Agreement by implied behavior (i.e., starting to willfully use the service).
* Some of the above preferably in front of witnesses or while creating a voice and/or video recording of the event.

The provider has legal basis for restricting in what ways the user may access the service.

## Benefits of restricting access method

No further elaboration would be needed, but let me share a few technical insights into why it is desirable for the provider to restrict alternative access methods (e.g., a third party client):

* Brand recognition: due to non-profit, hobby development, the alternative client might be inferior in user experience, performance, stability or accessibility and the user might wrongly associate these qualities with the service and also broadcast this association to others.
* Service stability: the alternative client might contain software defects or deliberate features that could overload some of the resources required for providing the service to others, including networking, storage and computation resources.
* Contractual obligations: the provider might have agreements with other parties regarding how certain functionality or material might be served to end users, governed by patents, copyright licensing or the GDPR.
* Monetization: the provider incurs significant capital and operational expenditures in connection with the service that they expect to eventually recoup. They have options for various valid business plans, some of which involve feeding endorsements through the client. The provider would clearly lose this potential stream of revenue if they had given up on building a sure base for their own client.
