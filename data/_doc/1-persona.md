# Persona

## foss

* altruist, cares about others, the wider society and our future
* believes in local sustainability, lives in a DFSG island (free libre software)
* writes and reviews code for her community, shares changes upstream
* can accept compromises in usability, willing to learn
* flexible in circle of trust if it serves independence
* prefers well tested real world solutions for real world problems
* understands real world security bottlenecks: has a bird's eye view of all the various kinds of defenses and attempts to apply protections throughout the system at a similar baseline level in all areas
* the monetization methods should ensure independence in sustainability, but not alienate or sell out users
* some providers may be boycotted for philosophical reasons, to serve the greater good
* Aim towards long term stability, try to converge to a set of solutions over the years instead of hopping from one to another.
* Prefer models and providers that have a clear sustainable future (and past)
* Take the ethical moral high ground in any aspect, for example when it comes to environmental protection (avoid proof of work).

## tinfoil

* selfish, only cares about herself
* public enemy, national threat actor, criminal
* wouldn't trust a family member or a friend to operate a service to share with her
* trust nobody (except developers and build system operators and their significant others, their own circles of social networking influence, the hardware manufacturer, their infrastructure provider)
* attempts to shield against all previously published theoretical threats, regardless of a cohesive threat model
* Actors with a bad reputation should be boycotted, but otherwise it doesn't matter who runs the show in the given year - if one opportunity closes down, just try to find another one.

## layperson

* expect a solution to be as easy to use as the market leaders and mimic its interface paradigms
* hopefully not many compromises should be made, because each disappointment will result in incremental churn
* would like to keep in touch with as many friends as possible, preferably on 1 or 2 platforms
* can jump into something new if it brings something new to the table
* can usually understand high level metrics such as effect on battery time, overheating, and abnormal amount of data transfer costs
* quality of life features are paramount: VoIP, video chat, group meetings

## crowd

* as in "crowdsourcing" or "citizen science"
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_science
* strive for sustainability (via FOSS) even after every major player went bankrupt
* separate resources (donating hardware and bandwidth resources) from authority (abuse control, moderation, peer discovery)
* scale through friend to friend networking and/or through best effort reputation, web of trust and elected supernode promotion
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friend_to_friend
* It's not a problem if an implementation is of low quality or lacks features, because that gives more opportunity for people to work on
* The protocol and architecture should support implementing most trendy features or lightweight alternatives (e.g., slideshows and push-to-talk)

## Private

* need to communicate sensitive information in the way you can whisper to someone or meet them in person
* willing to take some immediate compromises to features for a misuse resistant, user-friendly private messaging experience
* don't want to stand out as using something different to what everyone else uses as that draws scrutiny and attention

## Collaborative

* need various complicated features to enhance communication, expression, productivity etc.
* may be one or more members of the collaborative with decent technical skills to maintain the messaging solution for the rest
* information is owned by the members of the collaborative and in such small trusted organisations or groups of people, it is natural to sometimes delegate a bit of oversight to a few members

## Public

* just need an ethical and sustainable way to connect with strangers and other netizens over all aspects of life
* one of those things to connect with people over will be entertainment, so multimedia capabilities and extended feature set are probably required
