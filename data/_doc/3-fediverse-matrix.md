# The Fediverse vs. Matrix network

## Aims of The Fediverse

* Articles (posts) that can be independently interpreted
* Publishing: sharing of content on external platforms through a URL, E2EE is usually not relevant
* Search engine optimization
* Short and long form content
* The primary realization of content is through (conceptually static) web pages
* Circles of followers
* The reactions provided to a given post by different users appear together

## Aims of Matrix

* Real-time communication of message events: read receipts, online presence status, short messages with minimal or no formatting, updating past comments
* A messaging platform: delivering messages between users, optional public visibility
* Rooms for group chat
* The primary realization of content is through its own apps. Web apps also available, but are not optimized for sharing on external platforms over a URL.

## Social networking services

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_networking_service#Definition

* driven by user generated content: links, posts, comments, reactions
* accessible through a web browser
* a user may follow the feeds of other users
* a user may have feeds to show content generated by them and/or who they follow
* a user may maintain a profile
* commonly partly accessible without registration - for publishing use cases
* commonly has ways to assist discovery by categorization: labels, keywords, tags
* commonly able to update past posts and comments, but it is considered more durable, hence many systems only support redaction

### Fediverse is SNS

* It satisfies all points listed above by design.
* Well known examples: Friendica, Diaspora, Pleroma, Misskey, Hubzilla, Mastodon

### Matrix is not SNS

* they can be accessed through the "Internet" (web) - marginally
* user profiles - missing
* produce UGC - yes (message events in random rooms)
* discover UGC - marginally (no tagging, ones owned by the user can't be trivially collected and listed under their profile even if that existed, you can't even search for my own messages or mentions within a single room
* a user being able to follow another user - missing
