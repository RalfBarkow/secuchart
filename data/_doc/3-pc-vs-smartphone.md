# PC vs. smartphone threat level

A PC is a platform where:

* you receive daily updates
* on which you can keep installing major OS releases (or different alternatives) for at least 15-20 years without the ongoing generosity of the manufacturer
* on which you have full control (i.e., are root), influencing on how your RAM, storage and other hardware is being utilized
* where only your imagination limits what you can or will install and not the battery longevity, data conservation or whether you have 8GB or 16GB storage
* where you only usually have software and hardware backdoors and trackers if you are threatened (vs. everyone in case of mobiles)
* of which a meaningful proportion of parts can be cheaply swapped out for fixes or when upgrading to improve its performance over time
* where supporting productivity is a default, not an extension (keyboard, pointing device and various connectors for peripheral and communication)
