# PC vs. smartphone threat level

## PC advantages

A PC is a platform where:

* you receive daily updates
* on which you can keep installing major OS releases (or different alternatives) for at least 15-20 years without the ongoing generosity of the manufacturer
* on which you have full control (i.e., are root), influencing on how your RAM, storage and other hardware is being utilized
* where only your imagination limits what you can or will install and not the battery longevity, data conservation or whether you have 8GB or 16GB storage
* where you only usually have software and hardware backdoors and trackers if you are threatened (vs. everyone in case of mobiles)
* of which a meaningful proportion of parts can be cheaply swapped out for fixes or when upgrading to improve its performance over time
* where supporting productivity is a default, not an extension (keyboard, pointing device and various connectors for peripheral and communication)

## Former mobile exploits

If you are using an out of date version of a mobile OS, because perhaps the vendor did not produce as update for you, you may still be affected by some of these.

### 2016 Surreptitious Sharing

This could also be interpreted as a flaw within each vulnerable application itself as well.

> ‘Surreptitious Sharing’ Android API Flaw Leaks Data, Private Keys: vulnerability in messaging apps [using the API] like Skype and perhaps Signal, and Telegram, that could lead to privilege escalation and data loss, including private keys. The attackers were able to get Threema, and another encrypted messaging app, Signal, to share its database as an audio recording. The researchers claim they were able to retrieve the file, save it, and open it as a database file. The two claim Signal was vulnerable – chiefly because of the way it processed the file – and crashed for them on each start.
