# Serverless P2P messengers

## Disambiguation

"P2P" is ill defined, thus we discuss its conflicting meanings separately:

* #pan_mesh_dtn
* #hardware
* #lan_messenger
* #wan_crowdsourcing
* cryptocurrency/blockchain

## Commonalities

* Many definitions call for client communication without mandated custom intermediaries.
* "Server" can also mean either a technicality (socket programming) and a privileged and manually administered node within the topology
* Keywords (imprecise buzzwords): decentralized, distributed.

## Definition

Where did the term "P2P" originate from?

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer

> Peer-to-peer (P2P) computing or networking is a distributed application architecture that partitions tasks or workloads between peers. Peers are equally privileged, equipotent participants in the network. [...] The architecture was popularized by the file sharing system Napster, originally released in 1999.

Basically in the 90s, you could find centralized file hosts (FTP, BBS) where people would upload their wares from where others could later download them. Then came a new model where everyone could store their wares on premise and others could access it directly without having to upload/download to such centralized hosts and that was called P2P file sharing. So the term originates from a specific type of distributed storage where instead of operating centralized nodes with costly spacious HDDs and paying an arm and a leg for bandwidth costs, their specs could be greatly reduced by allowing peers (who either have or want the files) to chime in.

Applying the term to messengers is not trivial and I think it should be avoided if possible, especially as cryptocurrency scammers started using this label for their marketing efforts. However, I would say that such messengers would apply a network topology that minimizes the use of centralized nodes which could pose as bottlenecks or cost centers and should do as much computing on the edge nodes (the device within your hand) as feasible to enable this. The sustained growth of capacity would thus be ensured by the growth of the user base.

This also sounds to be in line with the spirit of unhosted web apps.
